# Wine Quality Analysis and Classification Project

This repository contains the code and data for a Wine Quality Analysis and Classification project. The project involves analyzing a dataset of wine samples, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training machine learning models for classification tasks.

## Files and Folders

The repository includes the following files and folders:

- `first.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code and analysis for the project.
- `Wine_data.csv`: Dataset in CSV format containing information about various wine samples, including features like 'fixed acidity', 'volatile acidity', 'citric acid', 'residual sugar', 'chlorides', 'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide', 'density', 'pH', 'sulphates', 'alcohol', and the target variable 'quality'.
- `results.csv`: CSV file containing the evaluation metrics of the machine learning models used for wine quality classification on the test data.
- `graphs/`: Folder containing several graphs and visualizations generated during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model evaluation stages. The graphs are saved as .png files.

## Project Overview

The Wine Quality Analysis and Classification Project aims to analyze the dataset of wine samples and build predictive models to classify the quality of wines based on their chemical properties. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis to gain insights, and the application of various classification algorithms.
Refer to `first.ipynb` for detailed explanation and overview.

## Results

The project aims to achieve accurate wine quality classifications based on the wine dataset. The evaluation metrics and visualizations in the notebook will provide insights into the models' performance and how well they generalize to unseen data. The goal is to develop a reliable and efficient model that can assist in wine quality assessment for future samples.

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook `first.ipynb` for detailed code, visualizations, and analysis of the Wine Quality Analysis and Classification Project.
